### <samp>**> Hi there üëã, I'm Shivam**</samp>

I created and maintain the [setup-php](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php) project. As part of that, I also maintain builds of PHP and various PHP extensions for different platforms. If you have questions or need help with any of my projects, feel free to reach out.

If you use any of my projects, a monthly sponsorship would mean a lot and make my open-source work sustainable.
